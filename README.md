# Cognitive SOAR: From Prediction to Attribution

## Project Goal
This project enhances a basic phishing URL detection tool by adding threat actor attribution using unsupervised learning. It mimics a real-world SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) environment.

## Dual-Model Architecture

- **Classifier:** Uses PyCaret to detect if a URL is benign or malicious.
- **Clustering Model:** For malicious URLs, a second model predicts the most likely threat actor:
  - State-Sponsored
  - Organized Cybercrime
  - Hacktivist

## How It Works

1. User inputs URL features into the Streamlit UI.
2. Model 1 (Classifier): Labels the URL as BENIGN or MALICIOUS.
3. If MALICIOUS:
   - Model 2 (Clustering): Assigns the URL to one of three threat actor profiles.
   - The result is shown in the "Threat Attribution" tab.
